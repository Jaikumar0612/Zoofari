		<p>DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE<br>
DR. SUNIL PANWAR, IFS<br>
Chief Conservator of Forests and Executive Director, Bannerghatta Biological Park.<br>
Bengaluru Bannerghatta Biological Park is a unique region of ecological importance as it's situated on the<br>
northern terminal point of Mysuru Elephant Reserve. The Park plays a major role in conservation of rich floral,<br>
faunal diversity , sequester carbon and sustains regional hydrology.<br><br>
As you are aware that our pristine wildlife and it's habitat are under severe pressure, the main objective of the<br>
zoo is ex- situ conservation and augment the depleting population of the endangered species. At present over<br>
2300 animals belonging to 102 species are being protected in naturalistic environment and provided with<br>
veterinary care at the Park.<br><br>
The Park is committed to realize the objective of National Zoo Policy,1998 by supporting the National efforts in<br>
conservation of rich biodiversity and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-15) Life on Land!<br><br>
I am sure that you are aware that the Park is not a place for amusement or entertainment. I am pleased to share<br>
that as a part of our Education and outreach activity under chinnara mrugalaya darshana program, over 1500<br>
students from Government schools were inspired by providing a guided tour at zoo on conservation of natural<br>
resources for maintaining ecological balance.<br><br>
At the outset I would like to mention that one of the main objective of the Park is to inspire citizens and<br>
create education to showcase the linkage between the survival of species and protection of natural habitat.<br>
As a result more enquiries were received by visitors on adoption of animals.<br><br>
My humble appeal to all the visitors is to make use of the display boards and signages to understand the<br>
nature and the important role we the Humans (Homo sapiens) can play in conservation and survival of species!<br><br>
I wish everyone to have an enriching, educative experience in the Park and spread the message of Conservation !!
